Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'ANTENNABWP30P140' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

        : Elaborating top-level block 'async_fifo' from file '/sim/tarsio/repos/sv-async-fifo-cdc/rtl/async_fifo.sv'.
Warning : Using default parameter value for module elaboration. [CDFG-818]
        : Elaborating block 'async_fifo' with default parameters value.
Warning : In legacy_ui mode, Genus creates a blackbox as description for a module is not found. Black boxes represent unresolved references in the design and are usually not expected. Another possible reason is, some libraries are not read and the tool could not get the content for some macros or lib_cells. [CDFG-428]
        : A blackbox was created for instance 'u_async_fifo_sva' in file '/sim/tarsio/repos/sv-async-fifo-cdc/rtl/async_fifo.sv' on line 124.
        : Check the kind of module a black box is. If it is a lib_cell or a macro, check why the corresponding .lib was not read in. This could be either due to a missing or faulty file or due to an incomplete init_lib_search_path attribute value making restricting access to the missing file. If it is a module of your design, verify whether the path to this module is a part of the files you read or else check that the init_hdl_search_path attribute is not missing some paths.
Info    : Done Elaborating Design. [ELAB-3]
        : Done elaborating 'async_fifo'.
Warning : Black-boxes are represented as unresolved references in the design. [TUI-273]
        : Cannot resolve reference to 'async_fifo_sva'.
        : Run check_design to get all unresolved instance. To resolve the reference, either load a technology library containing the cell by appending to the 'library' attribute, or read in the hdl file containing the module before performing elaboration. As the design is incomplete, synthesis results may not correspond to the entire design.
