Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design in mode 'analysis_view_0p99v_m40c_capbst_fastest'.  Either no paths in   
the design satisfy the exception's path specification, or all paths that        
satisfy the path specification also satisfy an exception with a higher          
priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by removing these           
exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a path in the      
design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or to see what   
other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use the command:
  report timing -paths [eval [::legacy::get_attribute paths <exception>]]

Inputs without clocked external delays

The following primary inputs have no clocked external delays in mode            
'analysis_view_0p99v_m40c_capbst_fastest'.  As a result the timing paths        
leading from the ports have no timing constraints derived from clock waveforms. 
 The'external_delay' command is used to create new external delays.
